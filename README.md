# Reflected-Header-Classes

Use UDELEGATE when you see something like void OnBlah in the dumps.
Use UFUNCTION when you see something like void someFunction, bool boolFunction, int numFunction etc. So any function of any type, that doesn't begin with On.
Use UPROPERTY when you see a variable in the dumps, e.g. float TimeLimit, bool isPlaying.
